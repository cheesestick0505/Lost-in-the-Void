Lost in the Void is a simple game written using the Pygame library.
The Void is a small world. Unfortunately, a robot is lost within it. Its name was KHS2628V. The robot was a prototype that had just left the factory. It so happened that KHS2628V was infected with a dangerous virus that completely erased its software, but something within it still changed... Help the robot return to its creator, avoiding villains along the way.
